## Which Programming Language should I learn First

Whether you are starting programming as a hobby, starting a new career, or just wanting to advance in your current position, the first thing you need to decide is which programming language you want to start with.

Of course there is no right answer. The choice of first language depends on the type of project you want to work on, who you want to work for, or how easy it is to be. Here are some personal suggestions that might give you a better idea of ​​which one to follow.
The most basic is **BASIC**. But it’s not very useful these days, it’s kind of obsolete.

The most useful is **C**, it is very closely related to systems and thus forces you to learn computer systems.

The most straightforward is **PHP**, although most tutorials out there are focused on Web programming requiring you to learn what Web is first!

The most complete is **Python**. It has huge amount of libraries and vast uses. It also has a delightful specification and syntax.

The most used yet annoying is **Javascript**. It’s just…. Javascript.

The most popular is **Java**. The relationship between Java and Javascript is like Car and Carpet. That means none. All old programmers know Java.

The most Windowsi is **C#**. It kind of forces you to live a Windows life.

The one with the most functional is **Haskell or Scheme or Erlang or Scala**. It’s useful if you wanna program airplanes or boast to your friends with PhD who don’t really know how to code.

The most non-programming language is **HTML**. It is not a programming language.

The most magical is **SQL**. It’s just lovely, but only used in databases.

The most weird is **Ruby.** Lots of fanboys but no practical use.

The most common is **C++**. It is definitely not C, and you definitely don’t need to learn it. Unless you’re learning Object Oriented concepts in college.

The most Applei is **Swift.** You kind of need to learn it if you wanna create apps for iSomething.

The most reliable yet useful is **Go**. It’s C++ on steroids but more like C and without the baggage.

The most statistical is **R**. It’s used for statistics and data analysis.

The most weird is** Perl**. It’s BASH on steroids and was created by aliens.

The most Googli is **Kotlin**. It’s All the crap from Java combined with all the crap from Android, and a ton of crap added on top.

The most rusty is **Rust**. If C++ is overrated, Rust is overrated++.

**The answer you'll inevitably reach is:**

"It depends." It all comes down to what about computer science excites you and what kind of career do you want to build. It's impossible to generalize, so feel free to use this as an opportunity for exploration. The answers will forever be in flux.

If you're remotely curious about how computers work, whether it's Arduino or Android. If you like to code. If you like to take things apart and rebuild them, Read further.

If you want a career that involves making programs that help other people use the Internet, understand media, in short: to produce content, then programming is probably the place for you.

If you are a complete beginner , There are 4 languages you might prefer starting with, C/C++ , Python or Java . If you want to start with the easiest , you can start with python as it is beginner friendly and easy to understand. However, If you learn Python first and then look to learn C/C++ or Java , you might find it difficult to catch up as they are comparatively difficult to understand. So, My suggestion is that you can either start with C/C++ or Java and then continue with Python. I personally started with C and then Python and it was really easy as you can learn everything with C and apply it to other languages pretty easily.

If you want to build apps or websites (front-end/back-end), then it's probably best to start with a JavaScript framework: AngularJS or ReactJS. There's a lot of other great options too—ReactNative, Electron—but these are probably the best known JavaScript frameworks for building apps fast.

If you want to build apps for Android or iOS, learn Java first. If you want to build websites for those platforms, learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript and then use PhoneGap or Cordova for building cross-platform mobile apps.

If you are really excited about artificial intelligence (AI), learning Python is essential. Please note that AI is a broad field, but Python is where most of the action is happening right now if you want to become a machine learning expert.

If you're interested in AI, machine learning, or data science (or specialising in any of these fields), it might be best to start with Python and R. These are interesting areas that are still developing rapidly. You'll be at the cutting edge of development if you learn any one of these languages now. If your goal is to work for DeepMind or Google then I'd suggest learning both R and Python as quickly as possible—the point being that one language is not enough for a developer who wants to work with advanced AI technology.

If you dream of writing an operating system or some other kind of low-level software, it's best to start with C# (Windows), C/C++ (Linux) or Objective-C/Swift (Mac OSX).

If you want to help people manage their food supply or save the planet, there's a lot of exciting industry-specific things you can do in Python.

So , in a nutshell , Look for the career you are interested in or passionate about and learn the appropriate language corresponding to that field.
