## Why Learn Python

Python is such a language that can help you develop almost anything. It is a great language for developing backend tools and other kinds of software and artificial intelligence stuff.

You can build anything you want using Python. The language can be used for web development, mobile app development, AI, machine learning, Big data and internet of things applications.

Google Search and YouTube are just some of the products that are powered by Python. There are several Google APIs and libraries that are based on Python programming.

**The following are some of the reason why you would like python**

Python is easy to learn
Python code is simpler and shorter, it saves developer’s time
Python has an excellent documentation available online
Python has a huge open source development community
Python has a rich library support
Python frameworks (Django, Pylons, Flask) are easy to learn
Python code is easy to write due to absence of overflow issues
Python has a huge market demand and the top notch companies are all moving to Python
Excellent new libraries and tools are being built in Python - an Open Source Software Library for Machine Intelligence

**APPLICATION OF PYTHON**: 
Due to the easier syntax and shell-interpretive nature python is a handy tool for students. Here are some of the practical situation where Python is extensively used:

Computer Vision , Image Processing and Graphic Design Applications
Data Analysis, Scientific and Computational Applications
Games
Web Frameworks and Web Applications
Enterprise and Business Applications
Operating Systems
Language Development
Prototyping
Other uses include : In ROBOTICS, MACHINE LEARNING, etc.

**ADVANTAGES OF PYTHON:**

Easy to learn, even for novice.

Time-wasting matters of style, especially regarding enclosing curly-bracket positioning blocks, simply go away.

Whenever you’re faced with a problem and are figuring out how to do it, there will be multiple well-documented ways.

You can become productive in Python fairly quickly even as a beginner, yet it will serve you in industry like a champ too!

No limits on integer size (If you are a C/C++ programmer you know that C can’t handle very big integers, say 21! . )

A humongous amount of library support.


Well-Documented.

**DISADVANTAGES:**

Because its an interpreted language therefore speed can be an issue. But now-a-days I don’t think its an issue with current processing power.

Design restrictions. Python devotees cited several issues with the design of the language. Because the language is dynamically typed, it requires more testing and has errors that only show up at run-time.

Sometimes large amount of indention can be an issue.
So, that was some of the advantages and disadvantages of python over other programming languages.

Many companies use it.
(Dropbox, Quora, Google, Yahoo Maps, Reddit, Youtube, DuoLingo and many more
Games: Battlefield 2, Civilization 4 and many more)

Many libraries available.

Its not just the popularity of the language but there is still a lot of reasons why people love Python.

**Beginner friendly:** Python is one of the most beginner friendly language and hence is preferred by a lot of beginners due to its simple syntax. Not only is it simple, but it has all the powerful features which a programming language needs to have.

**Has a wide variety of applications:** You can use Python for almost anything. Building backend for a web app, building APIs, data analytics, machine learning, image processing, geolocation, automation, testing and another wide variety of things can be done with Python which makes it versatile.

**Has a ton of modules and libraries:** Anything you need to do in Python, there is already a module for that which you can simply import and you don’t need to write any code form scratch. Python has modules and libraries for almost everything you would need.

**CPython:** The Python which most people interact with is CPython which is an implementation written in C. Which means that CPython can be used to integrate with a stack that already uses C. There is also something called Jython which can be used to integrate into Java code as well.

**Rapid prototyping:** Python is the most favourite language of startups because Python can be used to build prototype very rapidly. Meaning, developers can get something built in a very short period of time. The amount of time you can save in the development process will possibly be more and cost-effective.

**Speed is not an issue:** Most people will argue that Python is a much slower language than C, which is true. However one need to realise that speed is not always required unless you are using building some extremely time sensitive applications. One also needs to understand that no matter how fast the language is it will be bottlenecked by I/O in most cases. Your speed will be slowed down while pulling data from the database hence Python’s performance isn’t an issue in those case.
I could go on but will need to stop here as most relevant points are covered.
